# ArduinoProjects
Welcome to my little corner of Arduino experiments! This repo is a collection of projects I’ve tinkered with in my free time, all born out of curiosity and a love for messing around with microcontrollers. I’m no pro—just a hobbyist who enjoys blinking LEDs, wiring up sensors, and seeing what weird ideas I can bring to life.

## What’s Here?
This is a growing stash of Arduino sketches and setups I’ve played with. Some highlights:
- **LED Experiments**: Because who doesn’t love a good light show?
- **Sensor Toys**: Temperature, motion, whatever I could get my hands on.
- **Random Gadgets**: Half-baked ideas that somehow worked (or didn’t).

Check out the folders for individual projects—most have their own sketches and some notes on what I was trying to do. Nothing too fancy, just fun stuff I’ve hacked together.

## Why Arduino?
I got hooked on Arduino because it’s the perfect playground for anyone who likes building things without overcomplicating it. Cheap boards, endless possibilities, and a community that’s always got cool ideas to steal—er, borrow.

## How to Use This Repo
Feel free to poke around! Each project should have its `.ino` file and maybe a quick rundown of what’s going on. You’ll need an Arduino (duh), the IDE, and whatever parts I’ve listed (if I remembered to list them). Clone it, upload it, tweak it—make it your own.

## Current Projects

## Future Plans
I’ve got a pile of components staring at me, so expect more oddball creations. Maybe a robot that does nothing useful or a sound-reactive light thing—whatever strikes my fancy next.

## Say Hi!
Got a cool idea or just want to chat about embedded systems? I’m around. No pressure, just here to share the hobby.

Happy tinkering!
