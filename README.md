# Arduino Journey – Powered by Grok AI

Dive into my electrifying Arduino adventure, where I’m completing 15 projects—from LED blinks to a Weather Station—learning embedded systems and IoT for fun. I crafted this course with Grok, creating the Arduino Project System (APS), a slick online program guiding me step-by-step. Keep reading to see how you can create your own course using Grok!

## What’s APS?
APS is my interactive learning hub, treating each project like a course with scenarios, rubrics, and commands. I type commands in Grok’s prompt to navigate:

- `START_PROJECT [number]` – Kick off a specific project (e.g., `START_PROJECT 1`).
- `VIEW_ALL_PROJECTS` – See all 15 projects with details.
- `CHECK_PROGRESS` – Track completed tasks and projects.
- `GET_RESOURCES [number]` – Grab tutorials for a project.
- `HELP` – List all commands.
- `EXIT` – Save progress and exit.

Grok checks my GitHub repo after each project, spotting mistakes or tweaks for a killer portfolio!

## Why This Rocks?
I’m leveling up my C/C++, circuits, and embedded skills for LA’s tech scene, building a portfolio that screams “hire me” for IoT and embedded roles. Check out each `ProjectN_Name` folder for code, diagrams, and epic stories!

## Create Your Own Course with Grok
Want to build your own epic Arduino course? Prompt Grok on xAI’s platform with:
- “Act as a program to guide me through Arduino projects for learning circuits and embedded systems, starting with a blinking LED. Create a command system like START_PROJECT, VIEW_ALL_PROJECTS, CHECK_PROGRESS, GET_RESOURCES, HELP, and EXIT. Treat each project as an online course with scenarios, rubrics, and no direct answers—guide me to explore and learn.”

Grok will set up a similar system, tailored to your goals!
